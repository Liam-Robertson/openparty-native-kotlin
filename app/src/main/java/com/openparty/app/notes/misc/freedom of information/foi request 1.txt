Under the Freedom of Information (Scotland) Act 2002, I am writing to request access to records detailing West Lothian Council’s financial transactions over £10,000 for the 2023/2024 financial year. Specifically, I am seeking information on council spending across the following categories:

1. Education
2. Housing
3. Social Care and Health Services
4. Any other significant areas of spending

For each of these spending categories, I request a breakdown of transactions exceeding £10,000, including the purpose of the transaction, the amount, and the recipients or vendors involved (where publicly disclosable).

Please provide this information in an electronic format, such as a spreadsheet.
