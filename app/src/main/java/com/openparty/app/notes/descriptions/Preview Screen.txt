Newsfeed Preview Screen:
- The newsfeed screen shows all the latest issues that the local government has been dealing with
- It is a list of newsfeed preview items, each represented in a card (which is full screen width)
- The content inside the card should take up 95% of the card width and be horizontally centred 
- Each newsfeed preview item has these features: 
    - A title 
    - A thumbnail
    - A footer which contains these: 
        - A thumbs up icon
        - Next to that a number representing the number of thumbs up that newsfeed article has
        - A thumbs down icon
        - A commments icon
        - A number representing the number of comments that newsfeed article has 
- The thumbnail should be full width and be 70% of the height of the container (crop the thumbnail to achieve this if needed) 
- The rest of the card content should be under the thumbnail and take up the remaining 30% of the card height 
- The newsfeed screen should use infinite scroll
    - i.e. the user should be able to scroll down to see more newsfeed preview items and the scroll extends forever (or until items run out)
- when a user clicks on a newsfeed preview item, it takes the user to the newsfeed article screen
