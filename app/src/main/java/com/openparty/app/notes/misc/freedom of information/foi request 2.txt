// I think this is a good request but I ended up not using it
// What I'm asking for here is kind of insane, it requires a huge amount of accountancy and a lot  of legal work
// I think they'd likely charge me for this, or even just knock it back
// Worse, if I ask for too much they might just give bad or lackluster answers in order to meet the deadline
// I decided I needed to be more focussed so I'm not going to ask for the detailed financial  breakdown
// Instead, my main goal is to get the tree structure in all of it's granularity - map out what all the services are and how much they cost
// My secondary goal is to find out which services are statutory or discretionary
// My third goal is to find out the legal requirements from the government dictating these services (and getting a source for each) 
// The third goal in itself might be overkill, even that requires fairly serious law work 
// Having said that, figuring out which services are discretionary or statutory requires you to look at all these laws anyway so why not just give them to me
// I'm  going to simplify this request with these aims: Get the tree structure in full granularity, get the spending on each service, find out what's statutory or discretionary, if it's statutory, give me the laws

Under the Freedom of Information (Scotland) Act 2002, I am writing to request access to records detailing West Lothian Councilâ€™s services and financial transactions for the year 2024.

Please supply a list of the all services that the council provided in the year 2024.

Also provide the total amount spent by the council in the year 2024. 
The cost for all services given above should equal the total amount spent by the council in 2024.
If this is not the case, explain any discrepancies between the total spend on services and the total amount spent by the council.

For each service, provide the following information:
- A description of that service - including the reason the service exists, what it does and who it serves
- Whether the given service is statutory or discretionary
- The total amount spent on that service

Then break down each service into its primary functions.
For example, if the service was "Children's Services", then a function might be "Foster Care and Adoption Services".
If the service was "Adult Social Care", then a function might be "Services for Individuals with Disabilities".

For each function, give the total amount spent. The cost for all functions given above should equal the total amount spent for that service.
For example, if the service was "Children's Services" it might have the following functions: 
    - Adoption Services
    - Early Help and Family Support
    - Youth Offending Services
In this case, the cost of each of those function should add up to the total cost spent on Children's Services.
If the cost for all functions does not add up to the amount spent on the services then explain any discrepencies. 

For each function give the following:
- A description of that function - including the reason the function exists, what it does and who it serves
- Whether the function is statutory or discretionary
- If it is statutory, give the legal requirements for that service given by the government and give a source for that requirement (such as the document and page number it is found in)
- The requirements from the council for that service
    - For example requirements the council has mandated for that service
- A breakdown of where the money for that function was spent
    - For any area of spend, mention what the purpose of the spend was, what was purchased and who the money went to
    - If that money is given to a specific institution or company mention who it was given to and why
    - This only needs to be done for major areas of spend

All information I am requesting above is for the year 2024.

**
You probably need to give an example
Don't give too much guidance though or it'll ruin it

Also please supply me with the total spend for the council for the year 2024

Give a statement explaining the difference between the total spend stated above for all services for the 2024 and the total spend of the council.

If there is a major discrepency between the amount of total spend on services mentioned and the total council spend, give a breakdown of the major areas of spend

All information I am requesting above should relate to the year 2024, not any other time period.

Let me know if this request is likely to incur cost.
