Tony Pearson - Bathgate Labour Councillor
- This was the first councillor I'd really gotten to sit down and talk to about policy
- I feel like I both learned a lot and didn't learn a lot
- He thought I was a journalist - lol
- What did you learn?
- One really interesting thing he said was that the bylaws were almost never changed
- If you wanted to change a bylaw, it would take about 5 years to change
- If you wanted to see the bylaws, you might need to request them through the freedom of information act
- The bylaws don't seem to be the main way policy is enforce anyway
- It seems like the bylaws almost never change, and the way change really happens is through solicitors
- It seems like most enforcement is done through solicitors sending letters to people
- It also seems like individual councillors have almost no power
- They seem to spend time acting as middle men for small complaints
- For example, if there is a noise complaint or dog fouling or untrimmmed bushes, people talk to their local councillor about that
- It also seems like the local councillor has very few ways of enforcement anyway
- It seems like the local councillor primarily just sends out letters to enforce things, and then it takes like three weeks to get a response
- It also seems like a lot of the council meetings are about running day to day operations
- For example, the guy I was talking to was chair of the licensing committee
- So what they mostly do is to hold meetings if someone asks for a taxi license or something and they decide if someone gets the license or not
- So overall it seems like councillors don't have that much power
- They do seem to hold power as a whole though
- Individual councillors have little power, but an overall majority vote does have power
- Essentially what I learned was that a lot of the councillors duty is very boring and not things people care about
- Even the bylaws don't seem to matter because they are almost never changed
    - If you wanted to change a bylaw it would take five years or so
- The only thing that seems to have any power is the council meetings as a whole and a majority vote
- That really does seem to be something that actually does have power
- The real takeaway there is that the day to day counillor roles don't matter much, the bylaws don't matter much, only the council meetings matter
- The good thing about that is that the council meetings are all online and transparent
- It seems to me that an obvious place to start is just to watch all the council meetings and figure out what the fuck they're actually talking about
- I still don't get if the council meetings are actually reforming anything, or if they're just running day to day operations
- I also don't get how things are enforced
- I guess they must be enforced through solicitors but I don't understand how
- Overall your takeaway is pretty simple - you need to go through those council meetings and figure out if they're actually doing valuable work
- If they're just doing day to day operations that's probably less interesting for me
- If they're actually doing reform work then that matters a lot more
- Yeah you need to figure out what the council meetings are actually about
- Overall though, I liked Tony Pearson a lot. He was a lot less defensive than I thought he might be and he seemed reasonably happy to talk to me
- Seemed like a nice guy, also seemed pretty happy for me to get involved. That was more promising than Kirsteen
