The mission is this:
Decentralising Democracy

The values are these:
- Service to Society
- Security
- Ethics

- Security has to be the number one value, if you don't have security, everything else here fails
- Ethics is fairly obvious
    - You're doing something which is an enormous ethical responsibility
    - You can't take ethics lightly for this, it has to be unbelievably important
    - If something will make money but is slightly dodgy from an ethical perspective, then don't do it


Alternate value:
- Governance by problem solving
- Governance by problem solving is tricky to articulate
    - Essentially what I mean is focussing on detailed problem solving, mechanism and architecture
    - Grappling with the underlying details and mechanisms of how systems work
    - The opposite of this is campaigning
    - All the people who succeed based on being good at campaigning and charisma are the opposite of what I want

Alternate value:
- Truth
    - Most social media networks have a really hard time monitoring the conversation or censoring people
    - There will be a lot of conversation on this app and that means that will have to be directed somehow
    - I think directing it based on partisanship would be a wildly bad idea or even directing it based on ethics
    - I think the best direction is simple - truth
    - Truth is actually fairly measurable, you could create some sort of algorithm for truth
    - It also still allows for free speech and controversial ideas
    - But you do need some direction for the conversation, if you let it run free it'd probably be chaos like Facebook
    - The direction you should choose is truth
    - It's important to note that being true is not the same thing as being popular or even being ethical
    - I can think of lots of things that are unpopular to say and unethical to say but those should probably be allowed as long as they're true
    - Truth is something you can measure that includes everyone and allows free speech while not having internal biases
    - For example if you tried to moderate the conversation based on ethics what would happen is that it would just become biased towards your morals
    - You really need it not to be biased, it needs to be something universal. That's why truth matters


Alternative value:
- Service
- Caring about society
    - I think you might need a value that actually represents why you're doing this
    - You're not doing this because you care about security or ethics, you're doing this because you care about society and you want it to be better
    - That should probably be your number one value
    - You need something that represents why you're actually doing this. You want to attract people who care about the same thing
