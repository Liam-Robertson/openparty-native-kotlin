- That was really good
- She was smart, sophisticated, enthusiastic, passionate
- She knew what she was talking about and seemed passionate about the constituency
- She also seemed to value a lot of the same things you do. She valued decentralisation and grass roots movements
- I think she might be one of your main allies, she was very much on the same page
- Yeah, that was really good
- Funnily enough, I didn't get the answer to a lot of the questions I had but I got the answers to a lot of questions I didn't have
- For example I never really found out what goes on in the council meetings, I didn't have time to ask
- But I got a much better sense of the problems they are facing and what working in the local council is like
- The SNP focussed a lot on centralisation which means councils have a lot less control than they've ever had. That's bad for me
- Having said that, they do seem to have enough power to be able to do certain things
- I got roughly the same sense as the meeting with Tony - the bylaws aren't useful, being a day to day councillor isn't useful
- Pretty much all real decision making is done in the actual council chamber
- I also get the sense that pretty much all the real decision making needs a majority
- She seems to have a lot of frustrations about how big the labour majority is, they seem to get their way a lot
- This is probably bad for me, I sense a more fractured local council would be easier to influence
- It doesn't matter, you don't get to choose the hand you're dealt
- But overall I actually told Sally the truth which I didn't expect to. I told her what my idea actually was and why i was doing it
- I thought the idea was insane enough that I wasn't going to tell anyone what it was for a while. Everyone else I've talked to so far has called me delusional
- That's not fair, delusional is a bit harsh, but if I told most people about my idea they'd say it will never work
- Sally didn't say that, she was very enthusiastic. Having said that I get the impression that she's either polite or overly optimistic so I might still be delusional
- Delusional or not doesn't matter. What does matter is that I have an ally in the local council who is willing to try my app and participate in it, that's a major win
- She also gave me good suggestions on who to contact next
- She told me to contact Andrew MacGuire, she seemed to think he would be really on board with the idea and would be very competent
- I also asked her where I could find a user base, where the top 1% of most civic minded west lothian people are
- She told me the local community council could tell me who they are
- She also told me I could find them at the burgh trust
- But overall that went really well. I think I have one of the main objectives already - find someone on the local council who's willing to participate
- That's extremely good, I didn't expect it to go this smoothly
- I've also seen nothing that disproves my idea so far. I'm convinced that the centre of decision making is the council chamber and you need a majority for it
- It also still seems plausible that people would participate in this
- Sally seemed to think that I might well find a user base for this, she seemed actually reasonably certain I would
- She seemed convinced that there is a passionate group of people in Linlithgow who would very much jump at the chance to participate in a civic movement like this
- Overall I found that to be really optimistic, extremely good
- Getting an ally who is a councillor is a major step forward, that was always going to be one of the hardest parts
- I think your next action item is to find local consituency members who would actually be willing to participate in this
- I think if you had a councillor who was on this, and 2-3 users that would be enough to get started
- Now you need to find your 2-3 users, that should be your next goal
- But overall, very productive day, well done, I'm proud of you
- Write the code for the rest of version 1 and find your 2-3 users
- You might find that writing the code is the hard part for now, you still need to write your code and get it approved by google and/or apple before anyone can use it

Second Meeting With Sally
- This was good, I had most of the basic version of the app to show her i.e. the council meetings summarised and audio etc
- I still learned quite a lot from this
- I wasn't really there to show her the app, although I did do that
- Mostly what I wanted to know was what the relationship was between the council and public sector officers, teachers etc
- I wanted to know how rules are enforced and maintained
- I still don't fully know that, it's not something I really figured out
- One thing I did figure out though was that the difference between statutory and discretionary matters a lot
- Statutory being what is mandated by the government and discretionary being what is led by the council (i.e. that the council could choose to do or not do)
- It seems that most things are statutory
- I don't know, I still don't fully understand how the council implements decisions
- Like lollipop people are discretionary but where are the rules for them enforced and who enforces them?
