Initial goal:
- Get 10 people who absolutely love open party

Plan
- Make a spreadsheet of users, track every users level of happiness
    - Try to get users to the "love" level of happiness, be very honest about who is there and who is not
- Do individually nice things to each user to get them to the "love" stage
- Track daily active users
- Grow 10% each week
- Start with council housing meetings?
    - The council housing meetings seem to be decided by relatively few people. It's possible you could make real impact there

Simple manifesto:
- What actions could you take to reach your  two year goal in the next six months
- Do nice things individually to each user
- Be a super user
- Untargeted launch to find first users
- Use metrics to see who likes it most
    - Focus on delighting the users who already use it most
- Track daily active usage
- Ignore feedback from non ideal customers
- Grow at 10% every week g./
  - Be a super user - you should be the number one user on the platform
- Delight your users
    - Go out of your way to make them happy
    - Think of ways to make them happy12e34
    - Insanely great customer service
- Track daily active users - look at it every day
- Don't take feedback from your friends, they'll lie to you
    - Getting feedback from the right customers matters, it can't just be anyone
    - You need to find the people in the community who actually have this problem
    - For you, that will likely be the people in the community who are already doing community work and are involved
- Get 10 users who really love your product, not just like - love
    - It's better to have 10 people who really love your product than 100 users who like it
    - Find 10 users who truly love what you're building, then build for them
    - Find 10 people and make it your mission to make them ridiculously happy
    - That's your only job - make those people ridiculously happy
    - Care for them, ask them their needs, build for them, listen to them
    - Make those 10 people unbelievably happy
- Track users for daily usage. You're optimising for daily usage per user
- Focus - don't build too many features
- Simplicity
    - having a simple service makes it easier to use
    - having too many features causes clutter
- Magic moment
    - Figure out what your magic moment is and get each user to that when  you install for them
    - Is it just commenting on a post? Is it finding a post they really like
    - Maybe this will be based around communities and


To think about:
- Optimise specifically for councillor usage?
    - I think it's possible that the thing this app hinges on most is councillor engagement
    - If you can get massive councillor engagement then it becomes very useful
    - If you can't, then it just becomes something that is mildly interesting
    - Then again you could argue that the thing that will get councillors on board is having constituents on board
    - That might be true, I'm not sure
    - I'm not sure if you should maximise for councillor engagement or user engagement
    - I suspect in the short term you should optimise for councillor engagement
    - In the long term you should figure out if councillor engagement is based on user engagement
    - If that's the case, then you would need to just have the most users

UX Testing
- People are probably not going to understand your UX
- You should watch them use it to see if they can figure it out

Measure your time:
- Measure how you actually spend your time while working and categorise it
- I suspect the optimal split is probably talking to your users 50% of the time and coding 50% and nothing else
- You should measure this to see if this is what the split actually is
