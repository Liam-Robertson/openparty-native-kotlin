Account Types: 
- I also need different types of user accounts. These will be the types of accounts: 
    - Admin, Constituent, Representative
- An admin account is an account for a software developer
- A constituent account is a standard account type 
- A representative account is a higher privileged account than consituent but lower than admin 
- A representative account will have a title associated with it such as "Councillor" or "Member of Parliament"
    - I need to be able to fetch this account type from the database
- Representative accounts will have special permissions in future but I haven't written most of them yet
