- Another great meeting actually
- She talked quite a lot so I had to keep interrupting which was something I was a bit uncomfortable with
- But overall very passionate, likeable, competent
- There were a lot of things about her that I liked a lot
- She was also very passionate and open to the idea as well which i really liked about her
- Yeah that was really good. Another person who was very much on board and willing to participate
- I was surprised, my conversation with Kirsteen made me think that I would have to persuade a lot of people
- But that hasn't been true at all, these people have been very open and passionate
- They've been very attentive and attuned to the idea, it's been pretty great
- Yeah I'm extremely pleased with all this, this is going very well
- I didn't really bother asking her many normal questions about the council, I largely already knew the answers at this point
- Maybe the most interesting thing she said was that the council meetings are mostly about running day to day operations, they're very little about reform
- Overall she thinks that the council does very little reform generally
- She says that people tend to never change anything and tend to do things because it's always been done that way
- She thinks that change is very much necessary and needs to happen because they have such a tight budget
- I think this is a very interesting thing to hear
- It sounds like the council is somewhat ready for reform and needs it but doesn't have a mechanism for it
- She also seemed relatively on board with the idea which I hadn't much anticipated
- I've now told both her and Sally my idea largely in its entirety and neither of them told me it was stupid
- They both told me they thought it was possible and interesting and they definitely agreed it was something worth doing
- That's extremely interesting to know
- Again, I largely thought I would have to do large amounts of persuasion to make this work
- I thought people were going to tell me that I was nuts and I was going to have to play all sorts of games to convince them
- That hasn't really happened with anyone other than Kirsteen, everyone else has been very open to it and supportive
- Overall I thought that was very interesting and positive
- You now have two councillors who have agreed to try it and are very much onboard
- That's really impressive, I would have thought it would be much harder than this
- Also I suspect once you have a few, the rest are much easier to get
- The first few you get will probably be the hardest
- So yeah, overall the councillor side of this is going far better than expected
