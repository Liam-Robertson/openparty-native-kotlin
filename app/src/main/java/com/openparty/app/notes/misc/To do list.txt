Before launch:
- Firebase rules
- Analytics
- Prod database

To do:
- Check user registering database objects works correctly
- Initial loading takes a while. Also doesn't load everything at once
- Fix firebase database rules read/write
- Tracking user usage
- Better error handling
- Better logging

Later:
- Link youtube video in text
- Report bug page

Bugs:
- You can create an account that already exists (I think?)
