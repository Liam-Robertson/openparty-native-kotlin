  "content": "Hey everyone, I'm trying to figure out how to apply for a Council Tax discount in Scotland. I know there are reductions for single occupants and low-income households, but the process seems a bit confusing. Do I need to contact my local council directly, or is there an online application? Also, what kind of evidence do they usually ask for? If anyone's been through this and can share their experience, that would be super helpful!"
