  "content": "Hi everyone, I’m looking into applying for council housing and could use some advice. How do you even get started with the application process? Is it all done online, or do I need to go to the council offices? Also, how long is the waiting list usually? I’ve heard it can be years, but is there any way to speed things up? If anyone’s applied recently, I’d love to hear what the process is like and any tips you might have!"
