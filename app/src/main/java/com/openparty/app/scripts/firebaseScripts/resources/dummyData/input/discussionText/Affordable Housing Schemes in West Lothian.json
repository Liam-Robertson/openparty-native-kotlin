  "content": "I’ve been looking into affordable housing options in West Lothian, but it’s all so confusing. Has anyone here gone through the process and can share how it works? Are the waiting lists as bad as people say? I’m also curious if the houses are actually decent or if they’re just ticking a box for the council. Would love to hear if anyone has had any success with these schemes or if I’m better off looking elsewhere. Any advice would be much appreciated!"
