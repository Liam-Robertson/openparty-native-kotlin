  "content": "Hey everyone, I'm trying to navigate the school admissions process in West Lothian and could use some guidance. I know each home address has both a denominational and non-denominational catchment school assigned, but how do I find out which ones are mine? :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0} Also, what's the best way to apply for a primary school place? Is there an online form, or do I need to visit the schools in person? :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1} I've heard that applications for P1 places open in November for the following August intake, with a deadline of 31 December. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2} Is that still accurate? Any tips on making the process smoother would be greatly appreciated!"
