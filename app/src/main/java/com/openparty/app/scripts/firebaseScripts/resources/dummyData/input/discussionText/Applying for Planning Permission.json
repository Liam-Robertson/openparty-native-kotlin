  "content": "I’m about to apply for planning permission for the first time, and I have no idea what I’m doing. How long does the process usually take? Is it better to hire someone to handle it, or can I do it myself? Also, does anyone know how strict they are about small changes to the plan after submission? I’ve heard horror stories about delays and rejections, so I’m a bit nervous. Any tips or experiences would be really helpful!"
