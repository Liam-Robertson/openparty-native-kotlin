  "content": "Hey all, I'm trying to figure out the best way to pay my council tax online. I know some councils have their own payment systems, but is there a central platform for Scotland? Also, are there any fees for using a credit or debit card? And how do I find my council tax account number? Any tips to make this process smoother would be greatly appreciated!"
