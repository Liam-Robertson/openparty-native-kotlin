  "content": "Hey folks, I'm trying to figure out if my kids qualify for free school meals in Scotland. I know all P1 to P5 pupils get them automatically, but what about older kids? I've heard it depends on benefits like Universal Credit or Child Tax Credit, but the income thresholds are confusing. Also, does anyone know if there's support during school holidays? Any advice or personal experiences would be really helpful!"
